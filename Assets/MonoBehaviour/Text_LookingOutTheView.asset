  - I used to spend many summer days gazing at the distance, dreaming that one day I'd become a game developer.
  - My grandparents were still alive, and I loved to spend time with them.
  - My brother and I would run around town, pranking other people and exploring the woods.
  - It's so strange how little this place changed. In fact, it didn't change at all. How is this possible?
